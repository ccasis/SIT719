    "#This week we will use WEKA for experiments. Please see the weekly resources on how to download WEKA and how to use WEKA for supervised ML. I will cover how we can use multiclass classification problems as an application to solve an intrusion detection problem. I will demostrate multiclass classification using NSL-KDD datasets. Please follow the class lecturer and weekly resource. Tutors will also demostrate the same thing. Next you need to solve the similar problem as a binary clasification problem. I have also uploaded a vedio that explains the use case. Please see the contents from weekly resources and see my class lecture video. Thanks."
